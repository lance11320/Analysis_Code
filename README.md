# Analysis_Code
Basic analysis code for miniscope data; (Most code has been put here, some need to be revised for readability)

## minian_code
Using minian package to extract neural signal from miniscope videos;(Mostly the same as the Jupyter notebook they provided, but removed the visualizing part for batch processing. Also added some part of converting python array data to mat format because of poor coding ability)

## basicAnalysis
Merge the manual labeling and neural signal to generate 'PETH'; And do basic analysis with the 'PETH'.
